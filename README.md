# Tailwind CSS Gradient Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet uncommonly understood bug in Tailwind CSS related to gradients.  The issue stems from incorrect configuration, syntax errors in gradient usage, or CSS specificity conflicts that prevent the gradient from being applied correctly.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs when a Tailwind CSS gradient is defined, but either displays incorrectly or doesn't render at all.  This can be caused by:

* Incorrect configuration of the `tailwind.config.js` file.
* Typos in the gradient syntax.
* CSS specificity issues where other styles override the Tailwind gradient.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying the Tailwind configuration, confirming the gradient syntax, and resolving CSS specificity conflicts.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2.  (If needed) Install Node.js and npm (or yarn).
3. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
4. Start the development server (if applicable). 
5. Observe the unexpected gradient behavior in the browser.
